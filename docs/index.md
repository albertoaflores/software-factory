# ![](img/open-book.png) Software Factory Patterns

Building software is a combination of both art and science. Software is built by teams. Well designed, tested and documented distributed Systems are built by high performing teams. The Software factory is designed to provide all guiding principles so that high performing teams can produce software.

We define the following handbooks to describe each component of the Software Factory process.

## Factory Process Handbook
Every Software Factory implements a process. This includes elements that enables any team member be aware of how the Software is implemented from design to deployment.

## Developer Handbook
As previously described, developers need to be enabled to be productive as soon as possible so as to foster high performing teams. This handbook includes descriptions of how to enable developers to generate source code within this Software Factory.

## Platform Handbook
As high performing teams are generated, the use of a 'platform' is critical. This enables distributed systems to participate in an eco-system that is common to the enterprise.
